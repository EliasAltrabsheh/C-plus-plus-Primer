1) how would you declare each of the following :
a) char actors[30] ;
b) short betsie [100];

2) Declare an array of 5 ints and initialize it to the first five odd positive integer's?

int numbers[5];

numbers[5]= {1,2,3,4,5};

3) write a statement that assigns the sum of the first and last element of an even array ?

int even[5];
even[5] = { 2,4,6,8,10};
int sum = even[5]+even[4];

 4) write a statment that displays the second value of array called ideas?
 cout << ideas[1] << endl;

 5) Declare an array and initlize it to the string ?

 char array[] = "cheeseburger";

 6) write a strcture with fish

 struct fish
 {
 char kind[20];
  int weight;
  float length ;
 };

 7) do the same for type?

 fish elias
 {
  "seabass",
   16,
   5.7
 };

 8) use enum for folwwing :

enum response [] = {no , yes, maybe};

9) suppose ted is double varible , declare pointer to that ?

double ted;
double * pr;

pr = &ted;

cout << *pr <<endl;

10) suppose treacle is an array of 10 floats. Declare a pointer that points to first element and last element?

float treacle[10];

float * pr = treacle;

cout << pr[0] << pr[9] << endl;

or

 cout << *pr << *(pr+9) << endl;

11) write a code fragment that asks the user to enter a postive integer and then creats a dynamic array with many ints ?
unsigned int size;
cout << "Enter positive value :";
cin >> size;
int * dyn = new int [size];

13) write fragment of code that allocates dynamic memory of values ?

struct fish
{
  char kind[20];
  int weight;
  float double ;
};

int * dyn = new fish;

cout << "Enter kind of fish ";
cin >> seabass-> kind;
