1) What is the difference between entry condition  loop and exit condition  loop ?

Entry evaluates test condition  before entering the body of loop.
exit condition   evaluates test condition after  entering the body of loop.

2) what is output of following :
int i ;
for (i =0, i <5; i++)
   cout << i<< endl ;
   ???
01234

3) what is output of following :
int i ;
for (i =0, i <11; i+=3)
  {
  cout << i<< endl ;
  }
  cout << i;
   ???
0369
12

4) what is output of following :
int i = 5 ;
while(++i< 9)
  {
  cout << i++<< endl ;
  }
   ???
6 8
5)what is output of following :
int i= 8 ;
do{
  cout << "i" = << i <<  endl ;
  }while(k++ < 5)
   ???
   i= 8
as i++ will always condition  will be 9<5 which is false  so loop break after entering body once

6)Write for loop that prints vale increasing factor of two each cycle ?

int value  = 1;

 for (value =0 ; value <= 64 ; value*=2)
    cout << value << endl;

8) is the following statement valid(explain) ?
int x = (1,024) // This statm,ent will make x = 024 which is octal for 20 .
int y = 1, 0024 // This statment will ignor second part
