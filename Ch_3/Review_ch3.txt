1) Why does c++ Have more than on integer type?

We have the singed and unsinged . each with if we require only positive values to be stored.

we can also have types that suit us for best need for that particular calculation.

2) Declare variables matching following ?

A) short integer = short value = 80; // or short int which is 16 bytes = 32700
B) unsigned int value = 42100;     // value for unsigned is 16 bytes with = 65500
C) long value = 3000000000;  // max value for long is 32 bytes with 2.14*10^9 for unsigned it needs to be 32 = 4.29 * 10 ^9


3) What safe guard does c++ provide for using higher values  ?

it provides no safe automatically unless exceeding storage of type. However, We can Provide climate header file.
